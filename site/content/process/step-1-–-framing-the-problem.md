title: Step 1 – Framing the problem
subtitle: >-
  The discovery phase will typically start with one or more meetings to kick
  things off. This allows us to:
---
* Understand our client’s industry, business operations, digital strategy, customer or user needs, and the overall goal of the project.

* Learn about existing systems, operations, implementation details, and industry standards. This allows us to consume your business for knowledge and identify possible areas to improve or automate during the project development.

* It is imperative that we fully understand your goal. That is why we start from a high level overview and work our way down. This discovery will lay the ground work for the core scenarios and user requirements that will be needed to accurately forecast the development effort, necessary team resources, and overall scope of the project. This will also allow the client to understand what is possible based on budget and projected timeline.
