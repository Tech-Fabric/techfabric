  This is the experimental part of the process that allows the client to see how
  the project will bring real value to their business.

* Our seasoned designers will examine the requirements and “digest them for knowledge”. We then conduct research to understand the clients competitive landscape. This will help the designs stay consistent with current “mental models” within the industry.

* Our approach to UX design is systematic yet is often tailored to the needs of our clients. We typically start off by holding ideation sessions that will drive the user flow for the app.

* We then start to wireframe the UI, conduct usability testing to validate our assumptions, and identify issues with the UX approach.

* After the wireframes are completed and tested, we will then begin building high fidelity mockups and prototypes. The designer will work with the client to solidify a “design system” that will persist across the entire application. Visual aesthetics and graphic artifacts will begin to take shape as well. All of these elements come together to form a real look at what will become the application itself.
