title: Step 4 - Continuous Delivery
subtitle: >-
  Our team will continuously deliver project features through “agile sprints”
  while making course corrections along the way.

* TechFabric will form a development team that will consist of a UI/UX designer, front-end and back-end developers, a database and cloud architect, and a dedicated project manager.

* We follow the “Agile Scrum” method of development which allows the product owner to know and understand the status of the project at anytime. We manage it all with modern issue tracking tools.

* The product owner will dictate the acceptance criteria and our project manager will steer the ship towards project completion. QA is built right into the process to assure that deliverables are tested and feature complete.
