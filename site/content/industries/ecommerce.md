  The renowned online wine retailer partnered with TechFabric to digitally
  transform the way they manage their up-front inventory costs and warehouse
  workflow. We also helped create a much needed update to how their wine
  connoisseurs search and discover new wine and spirits. Microsoft Azure search
  played a key role in helping to transform the way their customers explore the
  world of bottled wine and spirits.
