  The radiology and diagnostic imaging company partnered with TechFabric to
  digitally transform the way they complete the new and existing patient
  on-boarding process. TechFabric used cutting-edge technology to bring the
  patient form & check-in experience from the waiting area to the patients
  fingertips. This automation drastically reduced the amount of work for
  SimonMed staff and created an efficient form process for patients.
