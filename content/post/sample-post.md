Tech Fabric had developed an enterprise level system to allow our financial clients to offer and sell our provider’s products. This included developing not only our internal applications but also our client facing and provider facing applications.

Tech Fabric also developed the interfaces between our platform and our financial client’s loan origination systems and our provider’s systems. They were also fully responsible for the design and development of the data security and compliance protocols.\
\
Being in the financial industry and working directly with consumer data within the loan process, this was a substantial undertaking and required certification by our financial intuition partners and our compliance and accounting firms. The application was developed using a responsive design allowing our system to run on not only standard business platforms but also tablets, and for the consumer facing portion as a mobile application..”
